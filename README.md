== Mvc.Extensions
Some extensions for MVC. Started out as a few helpful extensions for personal use, but has somewhat bloated recently.
Warning - there's not tests or specs ... my bad (arguably, you shouldn't be testing your extensions, but what your extension is embedded in, but that could be an excuse).
